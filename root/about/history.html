            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The Healing Paw was founded in 1990 by Dr. Sarah Johnson, a passionate animal lover who wanted to provide 
                top-quality veterinary care to pets in the local community. Dr. Johnson had a vision of creating a warm and 
                welcoming environment where pet owners could feel comfortable bringing their furry friends for routine check-ups, 
                as well as more complex medical procedures. Over the years, the Healing Paw has become known for its personalized care 
                and exceptional service, with a team of highly skilled veterinarians and support staff dedicated to helping animals 
                lead healthy and happy lives.</p><br>
